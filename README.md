# Creating my professional portfolio

# <Stepping with the right foot forward>

## Description

In the second module challenge, the task at hand was to create a professional portfolio webpage. The webpage will be enhcanced as the boot camp progresses. In the mean time, the only project we have done is the HORSEON. This was linked in the portfolio section. More sections and information will be added to my professional portfolio as my knowledge increases, and we progress further into the bootcamp.


## Installation

Installation was simple, since no starter code was given. I git initalized a local repository within my directory labeled module 2 on my local machine. I made all the files and directories using the CLI. Once I had my set up complete, I created a repository remotely on github.com. After, I copied via SSH keys and commited the files I made and pushed my local changes into the empty github repo. HTML and CSS were the only things used to create the site.

## Usage
The usage will be for me to have a professional portfolio as I progress through the bootcamp. As the bootcamp comes to a close, this portfolio will be even more interactive and nicer looking.
